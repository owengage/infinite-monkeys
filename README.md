# Oak logbook

Oak is a personal experiment to create a log book for taking daily or diary like
notes.

All other note taking software I have used falls massively short of what I want
from a note-taking application. Most offer fancy rich text editing, and maybe
some light tagging. I want something that can heavily self-reference itself, and
show all information about a topic you've logged about easily.

This is no where near done.

## Technologies

At the moment I intend for the note taking application to be entirely a
web-frontend. Once enough functionality has been developed I will figure out
some way of saving content to a server or local machine.

I'll be using the `contenteditable` attribute to create rich-text editing, and
generally taking advantage of as many modern web APIs as possible. I don't have
an intention at the moment to use an established framework such as Angular,
React or Vue.
